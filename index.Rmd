## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Summary: the goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise from
#the data set. First I picked all the numberical veriables that I think could be used as regressor, 
#Then I applied dimensional reduction on the variables to pick the most important variables
#I tried two models, decision tree and randomForest with Ten Cross Validation
#The results showed that randomForest is a better model with 97% accuracy, therefore I 
#chose randomForest model as the model for prediction
training<-read.csv("~/Desktop/pml-training.csv")
testing<-read.csv("~/Desktop/pml-testing.csv")
#pick all the variables that may needed and create a new data set
newdata<-training[, c(8:10, 37:49, 60:68, 84:86, 102, 113:124, 151:159, 160)]
#check percentage of zero values
lapply(newdata, function(x){length(which(x==0))/length(x)})
# $gyros_belt_y has 24% zero value, $gyros_belt_z has 9%, $pitch_arm has 17%
#$yaw_arm has 17%, $roll_forearm has 20%, $pitch_forearm has 20%, $yaw_forearm
# has 20% zero value
#Split data into train and test set at 7:3

#Dimensional reduction

#validate the model on Testing data set

#validate the model on Testing data set
pred2<-predict(mod2, newdata=TestingPC)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(pred2), as.factor(TestingPC$classe))
#The accuracy of the two model shows that randomForest is a better model with accuracy of 97%, 
#the the accuracy of decision tree is only 40% whcich is not a good model
#predict the testing data

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
